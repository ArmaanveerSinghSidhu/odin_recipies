# odin_recipies

For this project i will be creating a recipies website. 

Before starting the project, I possess some knowledge about HTML syntax and the boilerplate. I am familiar with some HTML tags. 

This project will contain a homepage with links to other pages for various recipies. At least thats what I think, just from reading the brief instoduction of the lesson.
